You can try to build the project with usual GNU way
but you'll have to specify all dependencies.

Build example:
Type the following commands in console, 
please replace /home/alex/Programs/ with correct path in your system

mkdir build
cd build
../configure \
--with-irrlicht-include=/home/alex/Programs/irrlicht-1.7.2/include \
--with-irrlicht-lib=/home/alex/Programs/irrlicht-1.7.2/lib/Linux \
